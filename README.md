### C\# vs .NET Framework

- C# is a programming language

- .NET is a framework for building applications on Windows

.NET consists of two components:

- Common Language Runtime (CLR): a component of the .NET Framework that manages the execution of .NET applications.

When a C\# program is compiled, the resulting executable code is in an intermediate language called Common Intermediate Language(CIL) or Microsoft Intermediate Language(MSIL).

- Class Library: a component of the .NET Framework that includes classes, interfaces, delegates, and value types that expedite and optimize the development process and provide access to system functionality.
